** Before you read this license, keep in mind that this Addon is for the game Minecraft, using the Forge mod loader. This is not intended to be for any productive use, this is just an experimental mod I, the author (Kalka) am working on. All rights are reserved. Full credit goes to HellFirePvP (https://github.com/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery) for the creation of Astral Sorcery. THIS LICENSE DOES NOT APPLY TO ASTRAL SORCERY ITSELF. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING ASTRAL SORCERY'S LICENSE, VISIT https://github.com/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/blob/master/LICENSE. DO NOT CONTACT HELLFIREPVP ABOUT THIS ADDON, AS IT IS UNOFFICIAL.

None of Astral Sorcery's original assets will be redistributed from this repository - any and all of AS source will be derived from the official maven at https://maven.hellfiredev.net. Any code that looks similar to the original is simply to stick with the source implementation as closely as possible. I am not intending to claim AS is my own and I hope that is not the case. Please send any and all credit to HellFirePvP. Thank you!
